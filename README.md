# IsraelJobMarketAnalysis
Israel job market analysis

In this project we will analyse the Israel job market using SQL and Python. We will gather raw data from the internet using web-scraping methodologies. We will use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to acquire the data and store it in CSV files. 
After that we'll Transform the files and then Load the data to our SQL database. From there we'll use SQL queries to get insights about the job market.
